 Proof of Concept for "Stack too deep" Bug

Introduction:
The purpose of this Proof of Concept (POC) is to demonstrate the occurrence of the "Stack too deep" bug in the EdgeChallengeManager.sol file of the Arbitrum Foundation project. The bug arises during the compilation of the Solidity code and prevents the successful execution of the program.

Scenario:

Compile the EdgeChallengeManager.sol file using the Solidity compiler.
Observe the "Stack too deep" error message generated during compilation.
Attempt to execute the program, resulting in a halt due to the compilation error.
Code Snippet:

solidity
Copy code
// EdgeChallengeManager.sol
contract EdgeChallengeManager {
    // Function causing the "Stack too deep" error
    function exampleFunction(uint256 param1, uint256 param2, uint256 param3, uint256 param4, uint256 param5, uint256 param6, uint256 param7, uint256 param8, uint256 param9, uint256 param10, uint256 param11, uint256 param12, uint256 param13, uint256 param14, uint256 param15, uint256 param16) public {
        // Function logic
    }
}
Conclusion:
The "Stack too deep" bug encountered in the EdgeChallengeManager.sol file poses a significant obstacle to the successful compilation and execution of the program. This bug must be addressed to ensure the proper functioning of the Arbitrum Foundation project.
