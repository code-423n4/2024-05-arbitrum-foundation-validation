### Impact
The vulnerability in the `EdgeChallengeManager.sol` contract from inadequate error handling, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of the contract. Specifically, the lack of proper input validation and error handling mechanisms can lead to:
- Attacker to access to critical functions due to missing input checks.
- Silent failures in critical operations, causing the contract to be left in an inconsistent state.
- Potential state corruption, where the contract state does not accurately reflect the intended logic, opening up avenues for exploitation.
- Increased risk of security vulnerabilities, including denial of service and manipulation of contract state by malicious user.

### Proof of Concept
The following links illustrate sections of the `EdgeChallengeManager.sol` contract where error handling is missing:

- [EdgeChallengeManager.sol, lines 451-488](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-arbitrum-foundation/blob/6f861c85b281a29f04daacfe17a2099d7dad5f8f/src/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.sol#L451-L488)

```solidity
function bisectEdge(bytes32 edgeId, bytes32 bisectionHistoryRoot, bytes calldata prefixProof) external {
    // Critical logic for bisecting an edge
    // Missing input validation and error handling
}
```

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Ensure all input parameters are validated
```solidity
function bisectEdge(bytes32 edgeId, bytes32 bisectionHistoryRoot, bytes calldata prefixProof) external {
    require(isValidEdge(edgeId), "Invalid edge ID");
    // Additional logic
}
```

- Handle potential errors from internal calls or state transitions. Use try-catch for external calls or 3rd party OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 for token transfers.
