## Gas Optimization Report

### Line 34:
The line `depositBalance[msg.sender] += amount;` is used to update the deposit balance for a specific address. However, this operation involves repeated updates to the same storage slot, which can lead to unnecessary gas consumption.

#### Optimization:
Consider optimizing the storage operations by maintaining a separate variable to track the total deposited amount for each address. Instead of repeatedly updating the same storage slot, perform the updates off-chain or in batch to minimize gas costs.

### Line 50:
Similar to line 34, the line `depositBalance[msg.sender] = balance - amount;` involves updating the deposit balance for a specific address. However, this operation also suffers from the inefficiency of repeatedly updating the same storage slot.

#### Optimization:
Implement the same optimization strategy as suggested for line 34. Maintain a separate variable to track the total deposited amount and optimize storage operations to reduce gas consumption.

### Line 50:
The line `depositBalance[msg.sender] = balance - amount;` is part of the `withdrawFromPool(uint256 amount)` function, which handles the withdrawal of tokens from the staking pool. While this operation is necessary for managing user balances, it suffers from the same gas inefficiency as the previous lines.

#### Optimization:
Apply the optimization strategy recommended for lines 34 and 50. Consider alternative storage mechanisms or off-chain processing to minimize gas costs associated with repeated updates to the same storage slot.

### Summary:
In summary, the gas optimization report highlights potential inefficiencies in the storage operations of the contract. By implementing optimization strategies such as maintaining separate variables and batch processing, developers can reduce gas consumption and improve overall contract efficiency.
